# OUTPACE

An uprising application because of the on-going crisis of COVID-19. 

The application uses your location and scans the area for anyone who is close to you and has a vibrating alert system.
The alerting depends upon the distance;
1) if the user is in close proximity to the another person with less than 6ft. then the device starts to vibrate continuously and shows a red display denoting "DANGER". 
2) If it is more than 6ft then the vibrations are pretty mild and display a yellow colour denoting "WARNING". 
3) Finally, if the user is at a safe dstance then the screens displays green denoting "SAFE".
